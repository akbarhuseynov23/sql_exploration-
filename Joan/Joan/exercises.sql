Dataset information: 
- store: the store code
- dept: the department code
- date: the date of the first day of the week
- weekly_sales: sales of the week for the store and dept

### The challenge
The objective of this exercise is to analyze the performance of different stores ('store') and departments ('dept').

For each question, include both your answer to the question and the query you used to arrive at the answer.

-- Exercise 1: Let's consider store 20
-- 1.1. What were the total sales of this store? -- "301397792.45999974"

-- 1.3.2. Y la peor semana ? De cuanto fue la facturaci√≥n ? -- 30/12/2011  //  "-798"

-- Exercise 2
-- The next objective is to detect the 'worst performing departments'. Specifically, we are interested in finding the departments that are farthest from the average sales of the store to which they belong.

-- 2.1. What were the total sales for department 51 of store 20? -- "161.18"
select Store, sum(Weekly_Sales) as total_sales from sales_joan
where Store = 20
	and Dept = 51;

-- 2.2. And the sales of the best and worst department of store 20? Which departments had fewer sales than dept 51? - Department 92 was the best one and departments 78 and 47 had fewer sales.
select dept, store, sum(Weekly_Sales) as total_sales from sales_joan
where store = 20 
group by dept

-- 2.3. How much did store 20 sell per department on average? (A number is requested as a result) -- "27057.53006296206"

-- 2.4. What is the difference of the total sales of each department with respect to the average sales per department of store 20? What are the three worst departments in store 20?
-- 	store	dept	difference

-- 2.5. Finally, which are the 10 worst department-stores, considering the performance metric from the previous year,
-- that is, the difference of a department's sales with respect to the average sales per department of the corresponding store.

#average sales of department of the corresponding store 
-- select store, dept, avg(Weekly_Sales) as avg_sales from sales_joan
